# meow-code

## 0.5.0

- Its launcher runs the shared executable, which now reads the record ADR-3090 describes; the unit itself is unchanged. This release retires epics and tasks. Before using it, run `paw upgrade` to preview and `paw upgrade --write` on a branch: `paw` refuses a record holding `tasks/` or `epics/` until then.

## 0.4.0

- Every unit's `requires.toml` now states its layer, the units it needs and, in a pack, the range of `meow-core` versions it works with, and the check fails a unit missing one.

## 0.3.0

- The skills work from a Pi package.
- The profile reads a personal file and refuses a machine path in it.
